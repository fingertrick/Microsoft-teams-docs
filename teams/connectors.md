# Get started with Office 365 Connectors for Microsoft Teams

Office 365 Connectors are a great way to push your app's rich content into Microsoft Teams. Any user can connect a team to services like Trello, GitHub, Bing News, or Twitter and get notified of the team's activity in that service. From tracking a team's progress in Trello to following important hashtags in Twitter, Office 365 Connectors help your team to stay in sync and get more done. You can even add rich actions to your content so that users can complete tasks right within the channel.

>**New:** With Microsoft Teams apps, you can add your existing Office 365 Connector or build a new one to include in Microsoft Teams.  See [Build your own Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/connectors-dev-dashboard#build-your-own-connector) for more information. 

## Accessing Office 365 Connectors from Microsoft Teams

In Microsoft Teams, choose the **More options** (**&#8943;**) button next to the channel name in the list of channels and then choose **Connectors**.

In the list, choose **Add** for the Connector you want to use.

For more examples, see [Accessing Office 365 Connectors from Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/#accessing-office-365-connectors-from-microsoft-teams).

## Using Office 365 Connector cards in Microsoft Teams

The Office 365 Connector card provides a flexible layout with multiple sections, images, and fields.

>**Note:** An Office 365 Connector card can display a maximum of 10 sections. Any additional sections do not appear.

![Example of an Office 365 Connector card](images/Cards/o365connector.png)

See the [Actionable message card reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/card-reference) for details about card fields and actions.

>**Note:** Teams currently does not support the `heroImage` field in Connector cards.

You can use the `O365ConnectorCard` class in the [Microsoft Teams extensions for the Bot Builder SDK](code.md#microsoft-teams-extensions-for-the-bot-builder-sdk) to send this card from your bot.

## Creating messages through Office 365 Connectors

You have two options for posting messages via Connectors:

- Set up a custom incoming webhook if you want an integration just for your team.
- Register a Connector and submit it as a Microsoft Teams app if you want others to use it.

Both options involve posting a simple JSON payload to an HTTP webhook to create the Connector message within Microsoft Teams. (For more details, see [Get started with actionable messages in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/get-started).)

You can also use the markup to include rich inputs, such as text entry, multi-select, or picking a date and time. The code that generates the card and posts to the incoming webhook API can be running on any hosted service.

}
```

This message produces the following card in the channel.

## Setting up a custom incoming webhook

Follow these steps to see how to send a simple card to a Connector.

1. In Microsoft Teams, choose **More options** (**&#8943;**) next to the channel name and then choose **Connectors**.
2. Scroll through the list of Connectors to **Incoming Webhook**, and choose **Add**.
3. Enter a name for the webhook, upload an image to associate with data from the webhook, and choose **Create**.
4. Copy the webhook to the clipboard and save it. You'll need the webhook URL for sending information to Microsoft Teams.
5. Choose **Done**.

### Post a message to the webhook

The following steps use [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/). We assume that you have this installed and are familiar with its basic usage.

1. From the command line, enter the following cURL command:

   `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"Hello World!\"}" <YOUR WEBHOOK URL>`

2. If the POST succeeds, you should see a simple **1** output by cURL.
3. Check the Microsoft Team client. You should see the new card posted to the team.

## Registering your Connector

With Microsoft Teams apps, you can distribute your registered Connector as part of your app package. Whether as a standalone solution, or one of several [capabilities](index.md#apps-in-microsoft-teams) that your experience enables in Teams, you can [package](createpackage.md) and [publish](submission.md) your Connector as part of your Office Store submission, or you can provide it to users directly for sideloading within Teams.

To distribute your Connector, you need to register by using the [Connectors Developer Dashboard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=780623). To have your Connector work in Microsoft Teams, select **Microsoft Teams** under **Enable this integration for**.

<img alt="Screenshot of enabling the Connector for Microsoft Teams" src="images/Connectors/connector_developer_portal.png" height="185" width="336">

You can download the auto-generated Teams app manifest from the portal. The following manifest.json file contains the basic elements needed to test and submit your app.

>**Note:** Replace `id` and `connectorId` in the following example with the GUID of your Connector.

#### Example manifest.json with Connector

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://statics.teams.microsoft.com/sdk/v1.0/manifest/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "manifestVersion": "1.0",
  "id": "e9343a03-0a5e-4c1f-95a8-263a565505a5",
  "version": "1.0",
  "packageName": "com.sampleapp",
  "developer": {
    "name": "Publisher",
    "websiteUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com",
    "privacyUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com",
    "termsOfUseUrl": "https://www.microsoft.com"
  },
  "description": {
    "full": "This is a small sample app we made for you! This app has samples of all capabilities Microsoft Teams supports.",
    "short": "This is a small sample app we made for you!"
  },
  "icons": {
    "outline": "https://outlook.office.com/connectors/Content/Images/IncomingWebhook.jpg",
    "color": "https://outlook.office.com/connectors/Content/Images/IncomingWebhook.jpg"
  },
  "connectors": [
    {
      "connectorId": "e9343a03-0a5e-4c1f-95a8-263a565505a5",
      "scopes": [
        "team"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "name": {
    "short": "Sample App",
    "full": "Sample App"
  },
  "accentColor": "#FFFFFF",
  "needsIdentity": "true"
}
```

## Testing your Connector

To test your Connector, sideload it to a team as you would with any other app. You can create a .zip package using the manifest file from the Connectors Developer Dashboard.

After you sideload the app, open the Connectors list from any channel. Scroll to the bottom to see your app in the **Sideloaded** section.

![Screenshot of sideloaded section in Connector dialog box](images/Connectors/connector_dialog_sideloaded.png)

You can now launch the configuration experience. Be aware that this flow occurs entirely within Microsoft Teams through a pop-up window. Currently, this behavior differs from the configuration experience in Connectors that we created; we are working on unifying the experiences.

To verify that an `HttpPOST` action is working correctly, use your [custom incoming webhook](#setting-up-a-custom-incoming-webhook).

## Publishing your app

>**Note:** Currently, we do not support users configuring your Connector externally via the **Connect to Office 365** button. Users must visit Microsoft Teams first to add a Connector.

When your app is ready for submission, follow the process to [publish your app to the Office Store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/submission).
